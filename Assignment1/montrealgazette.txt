A brown snake is seen at the Ecomuseum Friday, September 29, 2017 in Montreal. A Quebec biologist is highlighting the need to save some of Montreal's open areas from development in order to protect a rare snake that is found nowhere in the province except in the Greater Montreal area. The Ecomuseum Zoo recently finished installing hibernation caves and shelters in three nature parks in an effort to help the brown snake, whose grassy habitat is threatened by a real-estate construction boom.
Gregory Woolley, 46, of St-Hubert, and his longtime associate Dany (Lou) Sprinces Cadet, 48, of Mirabel, were both sentenced to overall prison terms of eight years Friday evening at the Gouin courthouse after they pleaded guilty to a series of charges filed against them in Project Magot. The Crown was represented by prosecutors Matthew Ferguson and Marie-Christie Godbout while Woolley and Sprinces were represented by defence attorneys Danielle Roy and Carole Beaucage.
